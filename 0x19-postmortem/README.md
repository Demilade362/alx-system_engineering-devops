# Issue Summary:

## Duration:
The outage occurred from 2024-01-15 08:00 AM to 2024-01-15 10:30 AM (UTC).

## Impact:
The authentication service was down during the outage, affecting 30% of users who were unable to log in, leading to a degraded user experience.

## Root Cause:
The root cause of the outage was a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, causing it to reject incoming authentication requests.

# Timeline:

08:00 AM (UTC):

Detection: The issue was detected when the monitoring system triggered an alert for a sudden spike in failed authentication attempts.
08:05 AM (UTC):

Actions Taken: The operations team initiated an investigation, checking server logs and network traffic for abnormalities. Initial assumption: A potential DDoS attack.
08:30 AM (UTC):

Misleading Paths: The team initially focused on mitigating a perceived DDoS threat, leading to traffic redirection and filtering. However, the issue persisted.
09:00 AM (UTC):

Escalation: With no improvement, the incident was escalated to the network engineering team. Further analysis revealed the misconfiguration in the load balancer.
10:00 AM (UTC):

Resolution: The misconfigured load balancer was identified and corrected. Normalization of authentication service followed.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause:
The load balancer misconfiguration led to an improper distribution of incoming authentication requests among the server pool. Some servers were erroneously marked as unhealthy, causing legitimate requests to be rejected.

## Resolution:
The load balancer settings were corrected to ensure proper distribution of incoming requests. Additionally, health checks were revamped to prevent false negatives, ensuring a balanced distribution of traffic.

# Corrective and Preventative Measures:

## Improvements/Fixes:

## Enhanced Monitoring:

Improve monitoring systems to promptly detect anomalies and misconfigurations in real-time.
Automated Testing for Load Balancer Configurations:

Implement automated tests for load balancer configurations to catch misconfigurations before they impact the production environment.
Documentation Update:

Update and review documentation for load balancer configurations to prevent future misinterpretations.
Tasks:

## Implement Health Check Tweaks:

Adjust health check parameters to reduce false negatives and improve the accuracy of server health status.
Training and Awareness:

Conduct training sessions to enhance the team's awareness of potential misconfigurations and their impact.
Load Balancer Redundancy Review:

Review the redundancy setup for the load balancer to ensure failover mechanisms are optimized for quick response.
## Conclusion:
The outage highlighted the critical importance of regularly reviewing and testing infrastructure configurations. By implementing corrective measures and preventive tasks, we aim to enhance the resilience of our system and minimize the risk of future outages. Through ongoing improvement and collaboration across teams, we strive to maintain a robust and reliable service for our users.
